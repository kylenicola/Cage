4. An overview of your project and app. Name the file <apkname>_overview.txt.
Replace <apk_name> with the same name as your apk file from part 2. The
overview must contain the following:
1. the team members names and uteids
2. a list of features / use cases you completed
3. a list of features / use cases from your application prototype (assignment 3)
that you did not completed
4. a list of features / use cases you added that were not part of the application
prototypeCS378 Assignment 7 - Beta Release and In Class Demo 3
5. a list of the classes and major chunks of code you obtained from other
sources including the source. (URL and title / description)
6. a list of the classes and major chunks of code you completed yourself

1) Team Names/ UT EIDS
Kyle Nicola (KAN346)
Nam Nguyen (ndn247)
Stephen Ridings (SJR94)


2) List of features / use cases completed
 
For the menu

-Settings to slow down the A, B, C game (kinda)
-About, Help pages
-Quit option

For the game Rattle The Cage

-Tracks the amount of the phone shaking
-Vibrates increasingly with each level
-Sounds of Nicolas Cage getting angry
-Changing of pictures and text
-Ability to decrease the level by not shaking the phone

For the game A, B, CÃ•s with N,I,C

- implemented a keyboard 

For the game Cage Clues, What Did He Lose?
-plays a scene from one of his movies expressing what he lost
-followed by a multiple choice question quizzing you on the scene

For the Scores page
-lists descriptions of what skills were tested for each minigame that are also buttons leading to scores (highest and most recent) for each of those mini games

3) List of features / use cases from our application prototype (assignment 3) that we did not complete

4) A list of features / use cases we added that were not part of the application prototype

5) A list of classes and major chunks of code we obtained from other sources

-For the ShakeEventListener, significant amount of code was taking from here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5117254. 

The general idea of how the listener works was taken from here, but gutted and used for my purposes.
  
6) A list of the classes and major chunks of code we completed ourselves.

For RattleTheCage.java most of the code is our own.  onShake especially with how it treats the logic on how to 
increase the vibrations/sounds and how to change pictures.  It also decreases if the totalDuration decreases which is nice.

For AbcsWithNic.java most of the code is our own as well. We implemented timing for the keystrokes, and a keypad of our own
for the game
